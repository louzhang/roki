# roki todos

~~crossed~~ = done

stuff to do in no particular order:

- update/maintain/fix existing modules
    - maybe go back to api based pokedex data instead of local data (easier to maintain)
    - add music autoplay algorithm
    - update/improve db queries
    - finish store commands
    - fix currency system
- add moderation commands
    - ban
    - temp ban
    - kick
    - prune
    - filters
- add reminder system
- add repeating message system
- add role commands
- ~~cache xp images~~
- guild specific user data (e.g. xp and currency values should be specific to a guild)
    - update xp image to show guild icon and or name
- guild specific configuration
    - add optional user presence event logging (i.e. user goes offline/online/joins/leaves)
    - channel specific configuration
    - command permissions
        - private message only commands
        - channel only commands etc.
        - certain commands only allowed in certain channels
- ~~change building process, and output directories~~
- add docs for building
- add build script

maybe:

- create channels with commands?
- custom commands (also maybe custom reactions)
- upload emotes

long term stuff:

- sharding
- setup website roki.sh for bot
- web interface to interact with bot settings
- new art
